# An iOS app that acquires tokens from AAD for accessing protected resources.

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

Check it out: https://github.com/azure-samples/ms-identity-ios-swift-native

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/NativeClient-iOS/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
